          The Foundationâ€™s mission is to serve organizations and communities by creating and implementing
          socio-economic initiatives that address critical skills development and entrepreneurship needs.
          These initiatives aim to establish, promote, and execute programs that equip individuals with the skills required 
          for success in the future workplace. South Africa faces a significant challenge in developing a skilled workforce. 
          Poverty limits access to conventional education, leaving millions of young people without the necessary skills to enter 
          the mainstream economy.
          <br /><br />
          Additionally, the rapid pace of technological advancements requires a flexible and adaptable
          approach to skills development that aligns with the future workplace needs. To address these challenges, the Foundation believes 
          that both non-financial and financial support is crucial for entrepreneurship development. Research shows that while there are efforts to 
          provide entrepreneurs with development programs, more support is needed to unlock exponential access to mainstream market access and a level 
          playing field for growth.
          <br /><br />
          The Foundation's approach to entrepreneurship development aims to redefine the concept of 'Value Chain Inclusion' by working closely with the 
          public and private sectors. By providing comprehensive support and fostering a culture of entrepreneurship, the Foundation seeks to drive motivation, 
          unlock growth, and create job opportunities which are currently a pressing issue in South Africa.
