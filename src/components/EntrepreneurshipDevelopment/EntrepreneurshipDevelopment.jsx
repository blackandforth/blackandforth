            Entrepreneurship in Africa, particularly in South Africa, holds immense
            significance in fostering economic growth, job creation, and social
            transformation. The continentâ€™s youthful population, coupled with its abundant
            natural resources and growing digital connectivity, presents a substantial
            opportunity for entrepreneurial flourishing. However, South Africa continues
            to grapple with stagnant economic growth and high unemployment rates.

            Despite the numerous entrepreneurship interventions initiated annually, the
            impact of these initiatives has yet to be realized in a meaningful and
            impactful manner. Our entrepreneurship development approach stands out in
            several ways. Unlike traditional approaches, it emphasizes ongoing support,
            enabling entrepreneurs to unlock the ability to realize return on investment
            in real time.
